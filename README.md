The "NextJS-SideBar" project is a web application developed using Next.js, a popular React framework. The project features a collapsing and expanding sidebar navigation system, allowing users to navigate between different pages seamlessly. 

Here's an overview of the project:

### Features:
1. **Sidebar Navigation**: The project includes a sidebar navigation system that allows users to easily navigate between different sections or pages of the application.
  
2. **Collapsing and Expanding**: The sidebar is designed to collapse and expand, providing users with more screen space when collapsed and revealing navigation links when expanded.

3. **Page Content**: Within the application, there are various pages such as symptoms, graphs, and other sections. Each page likely serves a specific purpose, such as displaying symptom information, visualizing data in graphs, or presenting other relevant content.

4. **Data Fetching**: The project integrates with an external API to fetch data dynamically. This data could be related to symptoms, analytics, or any other information relevant to the application's purpose.

### Technologies Used:
- **Next.js**: Next.js is the primary framework used for building the application. It provides features like server-side rendering, routing, and API routes, making it ideal for building dynamic web applications.
  
- **React**: React is the core library used for building user interfaces in the application. Components are likely structured using React to create reusable and composable UI elements.

- **API Integration**: The application integrates with external APIs to fetch data dynamically. This could involve making HTTP requests to endpoints provided by the API and handling the response data within the application.

### Project Structure:
- **Components**: Contains reusable UI components used throughout the application, such as the sidebar component.
  
- **Pages**: Each page of the application is represented by a file within the "pages" directory. These files define the routes and content for each page of the application.
  
- **API Routes**: If the application includes server-side logic or custom API endpoints, these might be defined in the "pages/api" directory using Next.js API routes.

### Usage:
Users can interact with the application by navigating through the sidebar links, expanding or collapsing the sidebar as needed. Data is fetched from the API to populate various sections of the application, providing users with dynamic and up-to-date information.

Overall, the "NextJS-SideBar" project offers a user-friendly and dynamic web experience, leveraging Next.js and React to create a modern web application with a collapsible sidebar navigation system.
